["index.html", "MIMIC III Chapter 1 Introduction", " MIMIC III 11/23/2019 Chapter 1 Introduction In recent years there has been a concerted move towards the adoption of digital health record systems in hospitals, and utilizing data to predict a patient’s condition or the cure rate of a disease has become mainstream.To comply with the tide,in this topic, we use health record data from “MIMIC-III” to make two main predictions. The first part is evaluating the factors which may influence 30-Day Mortality of Patients Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In this part,we analyzed the cuases of death of patients within 30 days such as age, gender, family care and so on. Then, we find some patterns between factors that have an impact on 30-Day Mortality especially for insurance type and admission location. At last,since insurance type has a large influences, we explore more details about it. More specific information and results are shown in the conclusion part.The second part is also interesting.Through the analysis of patients’ “stay time” in ICU, it was found that the time is obviously different. Actually, there is a gap between two group of people.The lack of “subject-id” between 35,000 and 40,000 in the ICU data may be due to the absence of intermediate patients in the ICU.According to the research data, it was found that the different distribution patterns of ICU stay time between 0 and 35,000 and more than 40,000 were speculated to be caused by some factors between these two groups.As a result, the second purpose of this project is to explore which factors may affect the different time distribution and gender of the two groups, age, disease, or something else? We sincerely hope that this topic can improve people’s attention to medical data, and have a deeper understanding and care for patients. "],

From the website “https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/”, MIMIC-III is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. The database includes information such as demographics, vital sign measurements made at the bedside (~1 data point per hour), laboratory test results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports, and mortality (including post-hospital discharge). To compare the 30-day mortality after accepted to ICU and other factorts, we used the admissions table, patients table, ICUstays table and DIAGNOSES_ICD table. To explian the staying-time distribution difference of two patients groups, we also use admissions table and ICUstays table. We merged different table by SUBJECT id, which is one admission to hospital and HADM id, which is unique to each patient. "],

We find that the data are distributed into to parts and there exists a gap in the middle part of graph. This can be explained by that the patients with id from 35000 to 40000 didn’t go to icu because their diseases are not required them to do that. But clearly there is a great difference between the two groups before ID=35000 and after. To make sure we didn’t misunderstand the data pattern, we group the data into two groups to explore its’ statistic distribution. And we use boxplot to make it clear. We can see in the first graph that two boxplots have similar mean, median, min and max, but have different outlier range. To make it clear, we use sqrt to change the y. In this case, there still a large difference in range. We try to find some factors that may explain this pattern. First we bin the data into two groups. group0 is id less than 35000 and group1 is id larger than 40000. In the 1st graphs, it is difficult to see the difference. Men and women are almost evenly distributed. The 2nd and 3rd graphs, group0 has NICU that group1 does not, we can pay attention to see if this pattern will help our research. In the 4th graph, there is no significant difference in the distribution of ethnicity between the two groups. In the 5th picture, we can see that group0 has the age group that group1 does not. In order to make the distribution of specific ages we gradually narrow the bin of the age difference. Finally, we found in the figure “Age bin changes 3” that there are many people in group0 who are younger than 1. We assume they are newborns. To make sure they are indeed newborn, we introduce diagnose to check if our assumption is right. As we can see in the graph, group 0 indeed has newborn which can explain the pattern shown in the point plot. "],

["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Part a) Evaluate the factors that have an impact on 30-Day Mortality of Patients Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) From the basic graphs, we can see how many patients of different gender, ages, ethnicity, admission location, and insurance type are accepted to ICU. They also show how many patients are dead within 30 days of their admission to ICU. We can see that first, the gender distribution is fairly even. Second, we have more patients with age higher than 45, and this is normal since older people are more likely to have emergent conditions. Third, we have more white patients who could cause some bias on ethnicity, and we will pay attention to this problem later. The portion of white patients is 71%. Fourth, we have more patients who have only Medicare, and more patients are from the emergency room directly. Finally, many more patients are alive within 30 days accepted to ICU. This is also normal because ICU saves people, not killing them. Then we want to find some patterns between factors that have an impact on 30-Day Mortality. First, we do not see some obvious patterns between ethnicity and 30-Day Mortality. The portion of each ethnicity is about the same as the portion of each ethnicity patients. The Gender shows the same pattern. However, for insurance type and admission location, we can see some patterns. More patients with Medicare and more patients who are transferred from other hospitals only die within 30 days. Finally, we want to see more detail between insurance type, admission location, and 30-Day Mortality. From the graphs, we can see that no matter the insurance type, transferred patients have the highest mortality rate, and no matter the admission rate, patients with Medicare only have the highest mortality rate. Therefore, we conclude that admission location and insurance type have impact on 30-Day Mortality of patients. Transferred patients and Medicare only patients have a higher mortality rate. This is partly because, as ICU patients, transferring from one hospital to a better hospital can waster a lot of precious time and cause higher Mortality. On the other hand, Medicare only patients tend to have lower income and lower living conditions, which may cause them to lose the best time to save lives. Part b) Explain the staying-time distribution difference of two patients groups In our exploration of the first part of the project, we did a lot of data cleaning. But is our data cleaning correct? We will try to justify it. In our first part, we filtered out all patients younger than 18 years old because of the following explorations. We observed the time distribution of patients receiving treatment in ICU and find that patients with subject ID before 35000 generally receive longer treatment in ICU than patients with subject ID after 35000. Why does it happen? This question is important because if we want to study whether the patient is alive within 30 days after receiving ICU treatment, we must study the factors that affect the length of time the patient is receiving treatment in ICU. Based on our series of analyses, we found that there was not much difference between the two groups in terms of gender and ethnicity.But there was a large difference in age distribution. We found that the number of patients under the age of 18 in the second group was much smaller than in the first group. To make things clear, we regrouped age. After several times of rebined, we found that the second group had no patients younger than 1 and the first group had 25% of patients younger than 1. Based on this obervation , we put forward a hypothesis: the first group may have a large number of newborns affecting the overall distribution. In order to determine that this hypothesis is correct, we divided the diagnosis into two groups, newborn and not newborn, and studied the types of ICU wards. We found that the second group had no NICU,which is aimed for babies, and no new born but the first group had many. This proves that our hypothesis is correct, and the number of newborns can explain the difference in distribution between the first and second groups. Therefore, our filtering out patients under the age of 18 in the first part is proved to be correct. If we do not filter out neonatal patients, our analysis will be wrong. As we all know, newborn babies need various treatments for a long time when they are weak at birth, but compared with the illness, once the newborns survive, they are more likely to stay alive rather than die. We cannot attribute all of this to treatment. Therefore, we have demonstrated that it is correct to wash out patients under the age of 18. "]
